# River-Gauge-Web-App

Lightweight flask application that tracks the local river flows near Glenwood Springs, CO. Originally, a whiteboard was used to track the flows which involved having to be manually updated every day where sometimes days would go by without being updated. The flow of the river is very important as 100 cubic feet per second (cfs) can drastically change some features in the river, so being able to see the current cfs before trips allows for a safer trip.

## How to Use

This application was made to customize to each user's preference of rivers, so the repository is not hosted but rather allows the user to download it and customize it themselves. Furthermore, a way to customize the rivers displayed in the application would be ideal, however, the names of rapids do not always translate to the desired section of the river, so creating a search was not an option. Users must find their desired river on maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html and add the rapid name and ID number to settings.ini file.
