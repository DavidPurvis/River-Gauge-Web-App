# River-Gauge-Web-App

Lightweight flask application that tracks the local river flows near Glenwood Springs, CO. Originally, a whiteboard was used to track the flows which involved having to be manually updated every day where sometimes days would go by without being updated. The flow of the river is very important as 100 cfs can drastically change some features in the river, so being able to see the current cfs before trips allows for a safer trip.
